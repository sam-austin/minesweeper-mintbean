## To Do

- Write recursive uncover function.

- Find bomb and flag icons for those values.

- Create flag toggle.

- I wonder if there's an algorithm for number of mines that are possible/reasonable within different board sizes.

- Create stopwatch timer, ideally to be saved as record on win.

- Create win state: all mines flagged === board state freezes, time score saved, victory/play again message; create lose state: mine tripped === board state freezes, defeat/play again message.
