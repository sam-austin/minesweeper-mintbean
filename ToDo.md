## To Do

### Must

- Insert bomb and flag icons.

- Create win state: all mines flagged === board state freezes, time score saved, victory/play again message; create lose state: mine tripped === board state freezes, defeat/play again message.

- Game rules/ help popover 

- Tom extra phrase

- spread out mines better

### Would be nice

- Set difficulty level dropdown menu

- update game board to have class name based on board size chosen (small, medium, large) and adjust CSS width based on number of columns 

- Create flag toggle.

- Save score data
