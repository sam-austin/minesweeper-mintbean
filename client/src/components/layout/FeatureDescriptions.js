          <p>Welcome aboard, Cadet. We've got a lot of bombs to sweep.

          Your Goal: Uncover all the tiles on the board that don't have bombs.

          1. Click anywhere on the board to start the game.

          2. The number on a tile indicates how many mines are adjacent to that tile (diagonals included!)

          3. Use your skills of reasoning and elimination to uncover tilesâ€”but don't hit a bomb, or it's game over!

            We three junior developers have put our caffeine- and curiosity-fueled brains together in this take on the classic desktop game Minesweeper. The project was conceived as an entry in Mintbean's Desktop Games Hackathon, and was built with React and Node. At this point we've spent more time playing it than we have building it, and we hope it hooks you too!
